                <p className='para'>Our focus has always been on preparing graduates to enter the workforce 
                while teaching our students to be leaders. Weâ€™ve worked hard to build lasting partnerships with 
                local communities while preparing our graduates to succeed globally - work we are confident has 
                led to our #1 ranking in the Greater Toronto Area for graduate satisfaction.
                <br/>
                Locally,we continue to offer industry-recognized full- and part-time programs at five Toronto 
                campuses. Whether in our classrooms, our labs or the community, Centennial students experience the
                 real world before they even graduate. They're job-ready, and that's a fact employers have told us,
                  as more than 88 percent of those who have employed Centennial grads are satisfied or very 
                  satisfied with their hires. </p>
